    ==================
    Module description
    ==================

    This simple module provides a basic interface to input/output operations on
    files. Its key design feature is the ability to work with both uncompressed
    and compressed files through a unified interface, thus, making it easier
    for a user to deal with various types of compressed files. The compression
    types supported include gzip, bzip2, and lzma (xz).

    The module is supposed to be mainly used by :mod:`pysat.formula`.

    A simple usage example is the following:

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> from pysat._fileio import FileObject
        >>>
        >>> with FileObject(name='formula.cnf', mode='r') as fp1:
        ...     contents1 = fp1.readlines()
        >>>
        >>> with FileObject(name='filename.txt.gz', compression='use_ext') as fp2:
        ...     contents2 = fp2.readlines()
        >>>
        >>> with FileObject(name='f.txt.bz2', mode='w', compression='bzip2') as fp3:
        ...     fp3.write('hello, world!\n')

        Auxiliary class for convenient and uniform file manipulation, e.g. to
        open files creating standard file pointers and closing them. The class
        is used when opening DIMACS files for reading and writing. Supports
        both uncompressed and compressed files. Compression algorithms
        supported are ``gzip``, ``bzip2``, and ``lzma``. Algorithm ``lzma`` can
        be used in Python 3 by default and also in Python 2 if the
        ``backports.lzma`` package is installed.

        Note that the class opens a file in text mode.

        as well as ``'use_ext'``. If ``'use_ext'`` is specified, compression
        algorithm is defined by the extension of the given file name.
