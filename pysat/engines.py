    Module description
    ==================

    This module provides a user with the possibility to define their own
    propagation engines, i.e. constraint propagators, attachable to a SAT
    solver. The implementation of this functionality builds on the use of the
    IPASIR-UP interface [1]_. This may come in handy when it is beneficial to
    reason over non-clausal constraints, for example, in the settings of
    satisfiability modulo theories (SMT), constraint programming (CP) and lazy
    clause generation (LCG).

    .. [1] Katalin Fazekas, Aina Niemetz, Mathias Preiner, Markus Kirchweger,
        Stefan Szeider, Armin Biere. *IPASIR-UP: User Propagators for CDCL*.
        SAT. 2023. pp. 8:1-8:13

    .. note::

        Currently, the only SAT solver available in PySAT supporting the
        interface is CaDiCaL 1.9.5.

    The interface allows a user to attach a single reasoning engine to the
    solver. This means that if one needs to support multiple kinds of
    constraints simultaneously, the implementation of the engine may need to
    be sophisticated enough to make it work.

    It is imperative that any propagator a user defines must inherit the
    interface of the abstract class :class:`Propagator` and defines all the
    required methods for the correct operation of the engine.

    An example propagator is shown in the class :class:`BooleanEngine`. It
    currently supports two kinds of example constraints: linear (cardinality
    and pseudo-Boolean) constraints and parity (exclusive OR, XOR)
    constraints. The engine can run in the *adaptive mode*, i.e. it can enable
    and disable itself on the fly.

    Once an engine is implemented, it should be attached to a solver object by
    calling :meth:`connect_propagator` of :class:`Cadical195`. The propagator
    will then need to inform the solver what variable it requires to observe.

    .. code-block:: python

            solver = Solver(name='cadical195', bootstrap_with=some_formula)

            engine = MyPowerfulEngine(...)
            solver.connect_propagator(engine)

            # attached propagator wants to observe these variables
            for var in range(some_variables):
                solver.observe(var)

            ...

    .. note::

        A user is encouraged to examine the source code of
        :class:`BooleanEngine` in order to see how an external reasoning
        engine can be implemented and attached to CaDiCaL 1.9.5. Also consult
        the implementation of the corresponding methods of
        :class:`.Cadical195`.

class LinearConstraint:
    """
        A possible implementation of linear constraints over Boolean
        variables, including cardinality and pseudo-Boolean constraints. Each
        such constraint is meant to be in the less-than form, i.e. a user
        should transform the literals, weights and the right-hand side of the
        constraint into this form before creating an object of
        :class:`LinearConstraint`. The class is designed to work with
        :class:`BooleanEngine`.

        The implementation of linear constraint propagation builds on the use
        of counters. Basically, each time a literal is assigned to a positive
        value, it is assumed to contribute to the total weight on the
        left-hand side of the constraint, which is calculated and compared to
        the right-hand side.

        The constructor receives three arguments: ``lits``, ``weights``, and
        ``bound``. Argument ``lits`` represents a list of literals on the
        left-hand side of the constraint while argument ``weights`` contains
        either a list of their weights or a dictionary mapping literals to
        weights. Finally, argument ``bound`` is the right-hand side of the
        constraint.

        Note that if no weights are provided, each occurrence of a literal is
        assumed to have weight 1.

        .. note::

            All weights are supposed to be non-negative values.

class BooleanEngine(Propagator):
    """
        A simple *example* Boolean constraint propagator inheriting from the
        class :class:`Propagator`. The idea is to exemplify the use of
        external reasoning engines. The engine should be general enough to
        support various constraints over Boolean variables.

        .. note::

            Note that this is not meant to be a model implementation of an
            external engine. One can devise a more efficient implementation
            with the same functionality.

        The initialiser of of the class object may be provided with a list of
        constraints, each being a tuple ('type', constraint), as a value for
        parameter ``bootstrap_with``.

        Currently, there are two types of constraints supported (to be
        specified) in the constraints passed in: ``'linear'`` and ``'parity'``
        (exclusive OR). The former will be handled as objects of class
        :class:`LinearConstraint` while the latter will be transformed into
        objects of :class:`ParityConstraint`.

        Here, each type of constraint is meant to have a list of literals
        stored in variable ``.lits``. This is required to set up watched lists
        properly.

        The second keyword argument ``adaptive`` (set to ``True`` by default)
        denotes the fact that the engine should check its own efficiency and
        disable or enable itself on the fly. This functionality is meant to
        exemplify how adaptive external engines can be created. A user is
        referred to the source code of the implementation for the details.
