    Module description
    ==================

    This module provides access to various *cardinality constraint* [1]_
    encodings to formulas in conjunctive normal form (CNF). These include
    pairwise [2]_, bitwise [2]_, ladder/regular [3]_ [4]_, sequential counters
    [5]_, sorting [6]_ and cardinality networks [7]_, totalizer [8]_, modulo
    totalizer [9]_, and modulo totalizer for :math:`k`-cardinality [10]_, as
    well as a *native* cardinality constraint representation supported by the
    `MiniCard solver <https://github.com/liffiton/minicard>`__.

    A cardinality constraint is a constraint of the form:
    :math:`\\sum_{i=1}^n{x_i}\\leq k`. Cardinality constraints are ubiquitous
    in practical problem formulations. Note that the implementation of the
    pairwise, bitwise, and ladder encodings can only deal with AtMost1
    constraints, e.g. :math:`\\sum_{i=1}^n{x_i}\\leq 1`.

    Access to all cardinality encodings can be made through the main class of
    this module, which is :class:`.CardEnc`.

    Additionally, to the standard cardinality encodings that are basically
    "static" CNF formulas, the module is designed to able to construct
    *incremental* cardinality encodings, i.e. those that can be incrementally
    extended at a later stage. At this point only the *iterative totalizer*
    [11]_ encoding is supported. Iterative totalizer can be accessed with the
    use of the :class:`.ITotalizer` class.

        clauses, the "native" encoding of `MiniCard

        Given an AtMostK constraint :math:`\\sum_{i=1}^n{x_i\\leq k}`, the

            can be specified: ``bound``, ``top_id``, ``vpool``, and
            ``encoding``.

            :type encoding: integer

            Parameter ``top_id`` serves to increase integer identifiers of
            auxiliary variables introduced during the encoding process. This
            is helpful when augmenting an existing CNF formula with the new
            cardinality encoding to make sure there is no collision between
            identifiers of the variables. If specified, the identifiers of the
            first auxiliary variable will be ``top_id+1``.

            Instead of ``top_id``, one may want to use a pool of variable
            identifiers ``vpool``, which is automatically updated during the
            method call. In many circumstances, this is more convenient than
            using ``top_id``. Also note that parameters ``top_id`` and
            ``vpool`` **cannot** be specified *simultaneously*.

            The default value of ``encoding`` is :attr:`Enctype.seqcounter`.

            The method *translates* the AtLeast constraint into an AtMost
            constraint by *negating* the literals of ``lits``, creating a new
            bound :math:`n-k` and invoking :meth:`CardEnc.atmost` with the
            modified list of literals and the new bound.

class ITotalizer(object):
    """
        This class implements the iterative totalizer encoding [11]_. Note that
        :class:`ITotalizer` can be used only for creating AtMostK constraints.
        In contrast to class :class:`EncType`, this class is not abstract and
        its objects once created can be reused several times. The idea is that
        a *totalizer tree* can be extended, or the bound can be increased, as
        well as two totalizer trees can be merged into one.

        The constructor of the class object takes 3 default arguments.

        :param lits: a list of literals to sum.
        :param ubound: the largest potential bound to use.
        :param top_id: top variable identifier used so far.

        :type lits: iterable(int)
        :type ubound: int
        :type top_id: integer or None

        The encoding of the current tree can be accessed with the use of
        :class:`.CNF` variable stored as ``self.cnf``. Potential bounds **are
        not** imposed by default but can be added as unit clauses in the final
        CNF formula. The bounds are stored in the list of Boolean variables as
        ``self.rhs``. A concrete bound :math:`k` can be enforced by considering
        a unit clause ``-self.rhs[k]``. **Note** that ``-self.rhs[0]`` enforces
        all literals of the sum to be *false*.

        An :class:`ITotalizer` object should be deleted if it is not needed
        anymore.

        Possible usage of the class is shown below:

        .. code-block:: python

            >>> from pysat.card import ITotalizer
            >>> t = ITotalizer(lits=[1, 2, 3], ubound=1)
            >>> print(t.cnf.clauses)
            [[-2, 4], [-1, 4], [-1, -2, 5], [-4, 6], [-5, 7], [-3, 6], [-3, -4, 7]]
            >>> print(t.rhs)
            [6, 7]
            >>> t.delete()

        Alternatively, an object can be created using the ``with`` keyword. In
        this case, the object is deleted automatically:

        .. code-block:: python

            >>> from pysat.card import ITotalizer
